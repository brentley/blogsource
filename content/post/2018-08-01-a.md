# Goal

In this session, we will go through the basics of Kubernetes and Helm. We would be discussing the complexities of writing and managing Kubernetes Yaml's and how we can overcome by Helm Charts. We would demonstrate, what it takes to launch a deployment using Helm Charts vs writing Kuberntes.  Next, a simple workflow demonstration of  CICD involving Helm, Git, and Jenkins. For the hands-on workshop, We will provide pre-built Kubenrates and Helm machines for attendees to try deployment using Kubenebtes and Helm
